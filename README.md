# SHEL
In this project called SHEL (for Schelle, Herz, Eichel, Laub) for the course 'Applied deep learning' at the TU Wien, we aim to build an application, that is capable of keeping score of players in the game 'Jass'. For this we build our own dataset, because the cards used for this game are not standard poker cards and we found no dataset online. A pre-trained YOLO model will be fine-tuned on this dataset afterwards. Implementing the model in an application that can detect cards in realtime wraps up the project.
