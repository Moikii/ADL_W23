# Project_name

In this project for the course 'Applied deep learning' at the TU Wien, we aim to build an application, that is capable of keeping score of players in the game 'Jass'. For this we build our own dataset, because the cards used for this game are not standard poker cards and we found no dataset online. A YOLO model will be trained on this dataset afterwards. Implementing the model in an application that can detect cards in realtime and is easy to use wraps up the project.

## Submissions for the Course

The submission of the first assignment can be found in [A1_Initiate.md](./assignments/A1_Initiate.md).
